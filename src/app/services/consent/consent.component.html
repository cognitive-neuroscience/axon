        <h4><b>STUDY PURPOSE</b></h4>
        <p>
            This study aims to use computer tests of cognitive function to identify mechanisms of cognitive 
            dysfunction in patients with Parkinson’s disease. You are being asked to participate in the development 
            phase of this research. We are recruiting a total of 500 men and women over the age of 18 for this phase of 
            the research study.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4><b>PROCEDURES</b></h4>
        <p>
            If you choose to participate you will be asked to complete two ‘brain games’ and three questionnaires, designed 
            to examine different aspects of cognition, where you will be required to use the keys of your keyboard to provide 
            responses.
            <br>
            This will take under 60 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4><b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b></h4>
        <p>
            This study does not involve the collection of any personal or identifiable information about you. Nonetheless, 
            your research data will be assigned a unique code number and stored in a secure manner on a McGill University server, 
            protected by standard physical and digital security measures, and will be stored for 20 years. For monitoring, control, 
            and security your study file may be examined by representatives of the institution or the Research Ethics Board. 
            All these individuals and organizations adhere to policies on confidentiality.

        <h4><b>BENEFITS</b></h4>
        <p>
            There is no direct benefit to you for participating in this research.  
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4><b>POTENTIAL RISKS</b></h4>
        <p>
            Despite removal of identifying information and the use of standard security measures to collect and store data, 
            in some circumstances it may be possible to re-identify individuals, however we believe this risk to be very low. 
            There are no anticipated physical risks of participating in this research. You may find the tasks dull or tiring.
