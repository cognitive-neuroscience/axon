                "Cognitive symptoms in Parkinson’s disease vary immensely. Some patients develop significant apathy or difficulty multi-tasking, others take up boxing or plan local support groups. Current tools used to identify symptoms fall short of being able to help us understand this variability because they don’t provide clues about the underlying brain mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to use computer tests of cognitive function, inspired by the tests used in laboratory animals, to arrive at a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. For this research study, we will recruit a total of 1000 participants, men and women, aged between 50 and 90."
